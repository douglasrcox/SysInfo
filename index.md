## SysInfo Tool

This was originally written circa 2008 in Windows Forms with .Net Framework 2.  I updated this project around 2013 to WPF.  It was a working project for Windows XP/7.

### Next Steps

1. Update to .Net Core 2 & XAML
2. Ensure compatibility with Windows 7/8/10
3. Add additional features as requested and implement the newer features of Windows for system administration
